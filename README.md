# Cervical Cancer Risk

By **Paula Pipkin** 

### Evaluating Cervical Cancer Risk :

This dataset focuses on the prediction of indicators/diagnosis of cervical cancer. 
The features cover demographic information, habits, and historic medical records.


### Data:

The data set source is the website UCI Machine Learning Repository and here is a link to the original data:

## Methods

- After some pre cleaning, two copies of the data were made so EDA could be done without risking leakage.  
- EDA was used to show correlations between some relevant features
- X models were applied, Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forrest


## Results



#### Heat Map for numerical Features
![sample image](plot1.png)

> The best correlation with the target is with Max retail price.

#### Sales of 2 different items and their respectives prices

![sample image](plot2.png)

> Even though MRP has the best correlation to Sales, it still does not explain why for the items above the sales do not vary according to the different prices.

#### Showing metrics for testing data:

| Model         | RMSE                   | R2       |
| ------------- | -----------------------| -------- |
| Linear Regression | 30002	 | 000 |
| Decision Tree |000             | 0006  |
| Random Forrest|000	|000
